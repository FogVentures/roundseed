                    | You should figure out how much you need.  Then remember that you will have administration and processing fees totaling about 7.5% of what you raise. 
                      Also, consider the cost of whatever perk or reward you want to give to your project supporters.  And not just the cost of the item, but also the cost of getting the item into their hands. 
                      Stamps may be forever, but they're also forever costly.

                      You should also consider how to leverage your rewards in different ways to raise the odds of success for your project.
                      For example, you might want to have a limited number of awesome rewards relative to the contribution amount. Think of this like a "party starter"... 
                      Donated items. And best of all, your product!

                    | First, we're sorry it didn't work out.  It does happen and we hate it when it does. However, you likely gained the best insights from your campaign itself. 
                      We're big fans of "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."  So, go ahead and make some of those adjustments, incorporate some of your first campaign's feedback and let's do it again.
        			  Your backers won't be charged if your project didn't meet its funding goals so you don't have to send refunds with your Thank You notes (you were going to write thank you notes, right?)

                    | We work with you to make this happen, and we're happy to do it - for non-profits.  Why scheduled gifts for non-profits? Because we love the idea of people supporting causes with scheduled gifts.
                      It's predictable giving for the backers and eliminates the expense of paying people or losing valuable resources to placing annoying phone calls and envelope stuffing when they can be better used to do so much more.
